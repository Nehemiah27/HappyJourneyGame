    <h4>Brief Discussion</h4><br>
    <article>
        <div><strong>Welcome to Nehemiah's Happy Journey Game</strong></div>

        <strong>About the Game:-</strong>

        
<!--Detailed expalanation of core constraints started          -->
        There are 3 Officials and <br>
        The Officials are holding luggage<br>
        The Officials are waiting in the Lobby with their Luggage<br>
        After a day long Meeting, Officials got tired<br>
        Company managed to arrange only one Servant/Driver to help the Officials<br>
        The goal is to make the Officials reach the cab with their luggage<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>There are 3 constraints</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Constraint no.1:</strong><br>
        At any point of time,<br>
        Officals either in Cab/at Lobby should be lesser/equal to the Luggage available<br>
        Otherwise, Officials might think the company have impolite culture<br>
        That might also leads to an Unhappy Journey<br><br>

        <strong>Contraint no. 2:</strong><br>
        The Servant/Driver can handle entities that are lesser/equal to 2<br>
        i.e., He can handle<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Offical+Luggage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Luggage+Luggage<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Official+Official<br><br>

        <strong>Constraint no. 3:</strong><br>
        The Servant/Driver has autophobia<br>
        So, he told the Officials that he needs atleast one entity with him at every point from Lobby when he is starting from Lobby<br>
        <br>
        At every point from cab when he is starting from cab
        <br>
        Official/Luggage in the process of helping the officials reach the cab<br>
        <br>
<!--End of explanation of core constraints          -->
        <br>
        <br>
